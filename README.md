# Build-A-Chat-Application-With-Firebase

- Run the project by opening the firebase-chat.html file in your Chrome browser, as this project does not require Node.js or React. You may need to turn off Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to get this project working.

- Next, create an app and enable both email/password authentication and Realtime database in your own Firebase console.

- Now, navigate to Project Settings and copy your own CDN Firebase config values. In the firebase-chat.js file, paste those values into the empty object variable called <b>firebaseConfi</b>. Once you have done this, you should be able to open the HTML file in the browser.
